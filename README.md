Project Description:

The Pacman is a single player game built on breadboard. The game itself will be all displayed on the Nokia LCD screen, and the supporting messages (informing the player) will be displaying on the LCD screen. The player’s goal is to move the Pacman (cursor) by the Joysticks, help Pacman eating the potential fruits on the map. There will be two type of fruits, “+” and “?”, pluses will be plusing 5 pts and question mark may give or minus 5 pts away from the user. There will be button for the player to see his/her score at any time as they wish. The player is able to start or reset the game at any time as they wish as well. The game will be lost if the player hit the wall, and they must reset the game if they do so. There will be two methods resetting the game, either using motion sensor or just clicking reset button, but both ways require two clicking the button to reduce accidental resets. After player achieve 20 points for the Pacman, and they will receive a “thank message” from the Pacman.
